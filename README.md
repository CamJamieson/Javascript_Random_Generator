# Project Plan
## Project Scope
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.
## My Project Concept
Rather than making a simple phrase that won't make complete sense, my project will be a mad lips generator.
### The Mad Libs Template

Ye can always pretend to be a bloodthirsty **(noun)**, threatening everyone by waving yer **(adjective)** sword in the air, but until ye learn to **(verb)** like a pirate, ye'll never be **(adverb)** accepted as an authentic **(noun)**. So here's what ye do: Cleverly work into yer daily converations **(adjective)** pirate phrases such as "Ahoy there, **(plural noun)**", "Avast, ye **(plural noun)**", and "Shiver me **(plural noun)**". Remember to drop all yer gs when ye say such words as *sailin'*, *splittin'*, and *fightin'*. This will give ye a/an **(part of the body)** start to being recognized as a swashbucklin' **(noun)**. Once ye have the lingo down pat, it helps to wear a three-cornered **(noun)** on yer head, stash a/an **(noun)** in yer pants, and keep a/an **(noun)** perched atop yer **(part of the body)**. Aye, now ye be a real pirate!

### Necessary Word Arrays
- noun
- adjective
- verb
- adverb
- plural noun
- part of the body

It would also be a good idea to only let the word be used once, so that the mad libs doesn't have repetative words.
